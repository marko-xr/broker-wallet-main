Branch:
recovery-profile-auth

Recovery baseline started from:
cc0951e

Verified Supabase-mode device behavior:

- Signup: PASS
- Home: PASS
- Profile: PASS
- Cold restart while authenticated: PASS
- Manual logout: PASS
- Restart after logout remains unauthenticated: PASS
- Login again: PASS

Completed recovery fix:
Notification token cleanup is best-effort and can no longer prevent authoritative
Supabase logout.

Authoritative logout verification observed:

- Supabase logout completed
- Supabase session after logout absent
- AuthViewModel unauthenticated

Recovery Step 2 — PASS

Verified on hosted Supabase:

- public.notifications is in the supabase_realtime publication.
- migration 20260822000500_add_notifications_to_realtime.sql was applied.
- RealtimeSubscribeException for public.notifications is gone on real device.
- Supabase logout remains PASS.

Recovery Step 3 — PASS

Verified on real device:

- Plain `flutter run` now defaults Auth/Profile to Supabase: PASS.
- Signup appears in Supabase: PASS.
- Login/Home/Profile: PASS.
- Startup Firestore offers/owners/offices/watchmen permission errors are gone:
  PASS.
- Logout and restart behavior: PASS.

Recovery Step 4A — PASS

Verified on real device:

- Unconfigured push notification registration no longer throws an unhandled
  UnsupportedError into signup/verification/login/logout flows: PASS.
- Signup: PASS.
- Email verification link flow: PASS.
- Login: PASS.
- Home: PASS.
- Profile: PASS.
- Logout: PASS.
- Login again: PASS.

Previously observed Welcome-page flash before Home is no longer reproducible and
requires no work now.

Recovery Step 4B — Profile name persistence:

- Name-only Edit Profile save writes successfully to hosted
  `public.profiles`: PASS.
- Hosted Supabase row updated and sync version increased: PASS.
- Cold persistence is authoritative from Supabase: PASS.

Recovery Step 4C — Profile screen refresh:

- Root cause was stale ProfileViewModel display state.
- ProfileViewModel now reacts to refreshed AuthViewModel state.
- New profile name appears immediately on Profile after Save: PASS.
- Home/Search/Favorites continue showing the same new name: PASS.
- Cold restart shows the same persisted name: PASS.
