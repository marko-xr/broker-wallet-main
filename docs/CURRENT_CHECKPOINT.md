Branch:
recovery-profile-auth

Recovery baseline started from:
cc0951e

Verified Supabase-mode device behavior:

- Signup: PASS
- Home: PASS
- Profile: PASS
- Cold restart while authenticated: PASS
- Manual logout: PASS
- Restart after logout remains unauthenticated: PASS
- Login again: PASS

Completed recovery fix:
Notification token cleanup is best-effort and can no longer prevent authoritative
Supabase logout.

Authoritative logout verification observed:

- Supabase logout completed
- Supabase session after logout absent
- AuthViewModel unauthenticated

Recovery Step 2 — PASS

Verified on hosted Supabase:

- public.notifications is in the supabase_realtime publication.
- migration 20260822000500_add_notifications_to_realtime.sql was applied.
- RealtimeSubscribeException for public.notifications is gone on real device.
- Supabase logout remains PASS.

Recovery Step 3 — PASS

Verified on real device:

- Plain `flutter run` now defaults Auth/Profile to Supabase: PASS.
- Signup appears in Supabase: PASS.
- Login/Home/Profile: PASS.
- Startup Firestore offers/owners/offices/watchmen permission errors are gone:
  PASS.
- Logout and restart behavior: PASS.

Recovery Step 4A — PASS

Verified on real device:

- Unconfigured push notification registration no longer throws an unhandled
  UnsupportedError into signup/verification/login/logout flows: PASS.
- Signup: PASS.
- Email verification link flow: PASS.
- Login: PASS.
- Home: PASS.
- Profile: PASS.
- Logout: PASS.
- Login again: PASS.

Previously observed Welcome-page flash before Home is no longer reproducible and
requires no work now.

Known defect:

- Changing only the profile name in the app appears in UI behavior but the new
  name is not persisted to hosted Supabase `public.profiles`.

NEXT STEP ONLY:
Recovery Step 4B — diagnose PROFILE NAME persistence to `public.profiles`.

DO NOT mark Step 4B complete.

DO NOT TOUCH YET:

- profile image / R2
- password
- phone / OTP
- delete account
- Search
- Favorites
- notifications backend setup
- push_devices
- Router
