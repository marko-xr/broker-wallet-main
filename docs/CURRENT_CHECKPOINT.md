Recovery work began on `recovery-profile-auth` from baseline:
cc0951e

Verified Supabase-mode device behavior:

- Signup: PASS
- Home: PASS
- Profile: PASS
- Cold restart while authenticated: PASS
- Manual logout: PASS
- Restart after logout remains unauthenticated: PASS
- Login again: PASS

Completed recovery fix:
Notification token cleanup is best-effort and can no longer prevent authoritative
Supabase logout.

Authoritative logout verification observed:

- Supabase logout completed
- Supabase session after logout absent
- AuthViewModel unauthenticated

Recovery Step 2 — PASS

Verified on hosted Supabase:

- public.notifications is in the supabase_realtime publication.
- migration 20260822000500_add_notifications_to_realtime.sql was applied.
- RealtimeSubscribeException for public.notifications is gone on real device.
- Supabase logout remains PASS.

Recovery Step 3 — PASS

Verified on real device:

- Plain `flutter run` now defaults Auth/Profile to Supabase: PASS.
- Signup appears in Supabase: PASS.
- Login/Home/Profile: PASS.
- Startup Firestore offers/owners/offices/watchmen permission errors are gone:
  PASS.
- Logout and restart behavior: PASS.

Recovery Step 4A — PASS

Verified on real device:

- Unconfigured push notification registration no longer throws an unhandled
  UnsupportedError into signup/verification/login/logout flows: PASS.
- Signup: PASS.
- Email verification link flow: PASS.
- Login: PASS.
- Home: PASS.
- Profile: PASS.
- Logout: PASS.
- Login again: PASS.

Previously observed Welcome-page flash before Home is no longer reproducible and
requires no work now.

Recovery Step 4B — Profile name persistence:

- Name-only Edit Profile save writes successfully to hosted
  `public.profiles`: PASS.
- Hosted Supabase row updated and sync version increased: PASS.
- Cold persistence is authoritative from Supabase: PASS.

Recovery Step 4C — Profile screen refresh:

- Root cause was stale ProfileViewModel display state.
- ProfileViewModel now reacts to refreshed AuthViewModel state.
- New profile name appears immediately on Profile after Save: PASS.
- Home/Search/Favorites continue showing the same new name: PASS.
- Cold restart shows the same persisted name: PASS.

Do not mark image/R2, phone, password, delete account or notifications backend
complete.

PROFILE NON-MEDIA CHECKPOINT — PASS

Verified by human on a real device:

- Name-only save persists correctly to hosted `public.profiles.name`.
- Profile screen reflects the new name immediately.
- `phone_number` before test: `NULL`.
- `phone_number` after name-only save: unchanged `NULL`.
- `phone_e164` before test: `NULL`.
- `phone_e164` after name-only save: unchanged `NULL`.
- No phone-field corruption is confirmed.
- No repository patch is justified.
- No code changes were needed for this verification.

R2 STEP 1 — SUPABASE PROFILE MEDIA CONFIRM RPC — PASS

Verified on hosted Supabase:

- `public.profiles.profile_media_id` exists.
- `public.media_objects` exists.
- `media_status` supports the required profile-media states.
- `confirm_profile_media_upload(...)` exists.
- The RPC is `SECURITY DEFINER`.
- `anon` cannot EXECUTE the RPC.
- `authenticated` cannot EXECUTE the RPC.
- `service_role` can EXECUTE the RPC.
- Migration `20260907000500` is applied remotely.
- Security lockdown migration `20260908000100` is applied remotely.
- Local and remote Supabase migration histories match.

Important security decision:

The Flutter client must never call `confirm_profile_media_upload` directly.
Only the trusted server-side Cloudflare Worker may invoke it using the
server-side Supabase secret/service credential.

R2 STEP 2 — CLOUDFLARE PROFILE IMAGE BACKEND PREVIEW — PASS

Verified preview behavior:

- `/authorize` without token: 401 PASS.

- MIME-mismatch upload is rejected by `/confirm` with 422.
- Rejected media row becomes `failed`.
- Rejected media is not linked to the profile.
- Good media remains `ready` and linked.

- Profile-media-id ambiguity migration was fixed and applied.
- Confirm RPC remains `SECURITY DEFINER`.
- `anon` EXECUTE: false.
- `authenticated` EXECUTE: false.
- `service_role` EXECUTE: true.

PROFILE IMAGE BACKEND — PRODUCTION PASS

Cloudflare Worker:

- Worker: `r2-profile-upload`
- Production endpoint: https://media-api.brokerwallet.ae

- `service_role` EXECUTE: true.

Do not repeat destructive backend security tests in production unless there is
a concrete reason.

FLUTTER-P1 — R2Config + R2ProfileUploadService — PASS

Verified:

- Production Worker default: https://media-api.brokerwallet.ae
- `R2_UPLOAD_WORKER_URL` dart-define override remains supported.
- Plain Flutter runtime requires no R2 Worker dart-define.
- `R2ProfileUploadService` supports:
  - authenticated `/authorize`
  - direct signed PUT
  - `/confirm`
  - `/profile-image-url` signed read
- User identity/token comes from the current Supabase session.
- No Supabase secret/service_role credential exists in Flutter.
- No R2 access/secret credential exists in Flutter.
- No signed URLs or auth tokens are logged.
- No Firebase fallback was added.
- Targeted analyze: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Backend production was already verified PASS.
- Real-device integration is N/A for P1 because no UI/repository path is wired
  yet.

FLUTTER-P2 — SIGNED PROFILE IMAGE READ — PASS

Verified by human on a real device:

- Login: PASS.
- Home: PASS.
- Profile opens: PASS.
- Existing R2 profile image resolves through the production Worker: PASS.
- Cold restart: PASS.
- Profile image remains available after restart: PASS.
- Name/profile text unchanged: PASS.
- No Auth/Profile crash: PASS.
- Previous screen-switching image flicker is fixed.
- Welcome-page flash previously observed after login is no longer reproducible
  and requires no current work.

Minor non-blocking UX observation:

- On a full cold app start only, the profile image may visibly refresh once
  before stabilizing.
- This does not affect data, authentication, Supabase
  `profile_media_id`, or final image correctness.
- Do not open a new fix for this now.
- Re-check during final Profile UX polish after upload integration is complete.

AUTH / NAVIGATION / PROFILE STABILIZATION — PASS

Commits: `94e7315`, `998e31e`, `ca77d03`, `905702d`, `5534730`.
Real-device status as recorded by the project owner in the Broker Wallet
Master Context (2026-09-12):

PHONE/OTP CHECKPOINT — DEFERRED (EXTERNAL SMS CONFIGURATION)

PHONE/OTP BACKEND + APP IMPLEMENTATION = READY
HOSTED DB SECURITY = PASS
REAL UAE SMS DELIVERY = EXTERNAL CONFIG PENDING
FINAL PHONE RUNTIME PASS = DEFERRED UNTIL SMS PROVIDER + UAE SENDER SETUP

Flutter implementation (committed in `0148dbd`; CODE_PROVEN, not
VERIFIED_RUNTIME):

- Phone change uses Supabase Auth's own flow only: `updateUser(phone)`,
  `verifyOTP(type: phoneChange)`, `resend(type: phoneChange)`.
- `public.profiles` phone fields are a read-only mirror of Supabase Auth; the
  app never writes them.
- No custom OTP storage, no fake success, no account merging.

Hosted Supabase phone database security — PASS:

- Rollback-safe database validation
  (`supabase/validation/phone_security_validation.sql`) passed on hosted.
- `authenticated` cannot directly update `public.profiles.phone_number`.
- `authenticated` cannot directly update `public.profiles.phone_e164`.
- `authenticated` can still update allowed fields such as `name` and
  `preferences`.
- The `guard_pending_phone_change` trigger on `auth.users` is installed and
  enabled.
- Normal authenticated users cannot execute the guard or cleanup functions.
- No pending `phone_change` existed at hosted verification time.
- Both phone security migrations are applied in hosted migration history:
  - `20260911000100_revoke_client_profile_phone_writes.sql`
  - `20260911000200_guard_pending_phone_changes.sql`

Real SMS delivery — EXTERNAL CONFIG PENDING:

- Supabase phone verification requires a real SMS provider.
- The Twilio account is Trial; production messaging needs an upgrade/payment.
- Broker Wallet launches in the UAE; a UAE production sender / Sender ID is
  required, and the business/trade license needed for it does not exist yet.
- Decision: do not pay for or configure production SMS now just to unblock
  development (see `docs/DECISIONS.md`).

Revisit final real-device SMS acceptance only when all of these exist:

- business/trade license
- production SMS provider
- UAE sender registration/configuration

This external dependency does not block unrelated Broker Wallet work.

EMAIL CHANGE CHECKPOINT — REAL-DEVICE TEST FAILED, THEN FIXED

REAL-DEVICE TEST (2026-09-12): FAIL. This falsified the earlier
CODE_PROVEN / READY FOR DEVICE TEST status recorded below.

Status after the runtime fix:
CODE_PROVEN AFTER RUNTIME FIX — AWAITING REAL-DEVICE RETEST.
Not VERIFIED_RUNTIME.

Hosted Secure Email Change is CONFIRMED ENABLED and stays enabled.

Observed failure:

- Request succeeded and the pending state appeared.
- Confirmation emails arrived; the user opened a link.
- The app reopened on `brokerwallet://auth/callback` with no state change and
  no success, partial-success or error feedback.
- Flutter logged an unhandled
  `AuthException(message: Email link is invalid or has expired,
  statusCode: otp_expired, code: access_denied)` from
  `GoTrueClient.getSessionFromUrl` via `SupabaseAuth._handleDeeplink`.

Hosted state read after the failure (read-only, no token values):
exactly one pending email change with `email_change_confirm_status = 1` —
the current-address token cleared, the new-address token still present. One
half of Secure Email Change was accepted; the change never completed.

Root causes, all three proven from source:

1. Error callbacks became unhandled exceptions. `SupabaseAuth._handleDeeplink`
   does catch the `AuthException` and re-publishes it with
   `notifyException`, which surfaces it as an *error on the
   `onAuthStateChange` stream*. Four subscribers had no `onError`
   (`home_viewmodel.dart` x2, `notification_service.dart`,
   `favorites_service.dart`), so it escaped as an unhandled async error.
   `AuthViewModel` did have a handler, but it treated any stream error as a
   failed bootstrap and reset the session to unauthenticated — an expired link
   could therefore present as a logout.

2. The intermediate confirmation was silently dropped. With Secure Email
   Change, GoTrue answers the first of the two confirmations with
   `?message=Confirmation+link+accepted...` and no `code`. The SDK's default
   detection heuristic only recognizes `access_token`, `code`, `error`,
   `error_code` or `error_description`, so that link matched nothing, was never
   delivered anywhere, and the UI could not react.

3. Resend was addressed to the wrong mailbox. `resendEmailChange` passed the
   pending address. GoTrue's resend handler resolves the account with
   `FindUserByEmailAndAudience` over `users.email`, which still holds the
   confirmed address while a change is pending, and then sends to the stored
   `user.EmailChange` itself. The resend could never have worked.

Fix:

- Automatic URI detection stays ON. `detectSessionInUriPredicate` now narrows
  which links Supabase exchanges to those actually carrying `access_token` or
  `code`, so signup verification, magic link, recovery and OAuth are untouched
  while error-only and message-only links are no longer fed to
  `getSessionFromUrl`.
- One application-level `AuthCallbackCoordinator` owns a single subscription to
  `AppLinks()` — itself a singleton, so no second native listener — and
  publishes only the callbacks Supabase declined, classified as session /
  error / informational / unknown. It never creates, refreshes or invalidates a
  session. Supabase remains the only session authority, `AuthViewModel` remains
  the application identity owner, and GoRouter remains navigation authority.
- A callback is only a *trigger*: `EmailChangeViewModel` always re-reads the
  authoritative Supabase user and describes that result. Nothing is concluded
  from the link's own wording, which Supabase may change.
- Only `error` and `error_code` are carried out of a callback. The provider's
  `error_description`, and any token or hash in the link, are dropped at the
  classification boundary and never logged or rendered.
- `resendEmailChange` now sends the confirmed address.
- Every auth-stream subscriber has an `onError`, and an auth-stream error no
  longer demotes an established session — only an unresolved bootstrap may
  still resolve to unauthenticated.

Verified from GoTrue server source (`sendEmailChange`), which both
`UserUpdate` and `Resend` call:

- Secure Email Change regenerates `EmailChangeTokenCurrent` and
  `EmailChangeTokenNew` and resets `EmailChangeConfirmStatus` to 0.
- So a resend, and equally a fresh request for a different address, invalidates
  the earlier links and discards any approval already given. The UI says this.
- A fresh request therefore safely replaces a pending one, which is what makes
  "Use a different email" a real recovery action rather than a fake cancel.
- There is still no server-side cancellation API, so no cancel action is
  offered.

UX redesign:

- Edit Profile keeps the confirmed email as the primary identity row and, while
  pending, carries only a single compact "Email change pending / new address /
  View" line. The large status card was removed.
- The pending detail lives in a focused sheet: current -> new transition with
  Active / Awaiting approval badges, the two-inbox explanation, Check status
  (primary), Send fresh verification emails (secondary, with the cooldown in
  the button label rather than a countdown element), Use a different email, and
  Close, which is always present.
- Returning from the mail app refreshes state automatically, via the callback
  and via a throttled resume that only runs while something is pending.
- Feedback is chosen from authoritative state: completed, partially confirmed
  (only after an informational callback), still pending, or a localized link
  error. No raw provider text reaches the UI.

Local verification after the fix:

- Focused email-change suite: 15/15 PASS.
- New callback/runtime-failure suite: 20/20 PASS.
- Full Flutter suite: 238/238 PASS (was 218).
- `flutter analyze lib test`: zero errors, zero warnings; 112 existing
  informational deprecations in unrelated files.
- No migration, RLS change, Edge Function, email template, hosted setting or
  deployment was touched.

Still unverified — requires the real-device retest:

- Real confirmation emails for both mailboxes after a fresh request.
- The intermediate callback producing partial-confirmation feedback.
- The final callback completing the change and updating the confirmed email.
- An expired link producing the localized recovery state and no crash.
- `public.profiles.email` mirror and cold restart after a real confirmation.

Known unresolved risk: Supabase documents that some mail providers prefetch
links, which consumes `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` and yields exactly this
"expired or invalid" error. The recovery path now handles that case, but if
fresh links keep failing immediately in controlled retesting, the cause is
prefetch, not this fix, and an OTP-based Email Change template becomes a
separate decision. No email template was changed here.

Historical record of the now-falsified status follows.

EMAIL CHANGE CHECKPOINT — CODE_PROVEN / READY FOR DEVICE TEST

Local implementation and verification completed on 2026-09-12. This is not
VERIFIED_RUNTIME until the hosted setting and real-device mailbox/callback flow
are exercised.

Implemented behavior:

- Existing authenticated Supabase users can start an email change from Edit
  Profile without a second password ceremony.
- `auth.users.email` remains canonical until Supabase confirms the change.
- Pending presentation comes only from Supabase `User.newEmail` and
  `emailChangeSentAt`; no durable client copy is created.
- Request and resend use the current Supabase session uid, the existing
  `brokerwallet://auth/callback`, and the pinned SDK's
  `resend(type: emailChange)` support.
- Auth identity and pending email share the repository's existing single
  Supabase auth-event pipeline. An authoritative `getUser()` refresh publishes
  completion to `AuthViewModel` without a second auth listener.
- Flutter never writes `public.profiles.email`; the existing server identity
  sync remains responsible for the mirror.
- There is no fake server cancellation. UI copy states that ignoring the
  request leaves the current confirmed email unchanged.
- Supabase failures are mapped to fixed domain outcomes and localized EN/AR;
  raw provider messages and exceptions do not reach this UI.
- The conditional no-email Add Email flow remains unchanged and separate. It
  still carries the previously audited Firebase-oriented/partial-update risk.
- The previously unreachable `SupabaseAuthRepository.updateEmail(newEmail,
  currentPassword)` override no longer performs its own password
  reauthentication ceremony. It now delegates to `requestEmailChange` so the
  backend-neutral legacy contract and the Supabase capability cannot diverge.
  `currentPassword` is accepted and ignored in Supabase mode. The Firebase and
  Mock implementations of that contract are unchanged.

Verification completed:

- Focused email-change suite: 15/15 PASS.
- Full Flutter suite: 218/218 PASS.
- Focused analyzer for changed Dart files: no issues.
- `flutter analyze lib test`: zero errors, zero warnings; 112 existing
  informational deprecations in unrelated files.
- No database migration, RLS change, Edge Function, hosted setting change, or
  deployment was made.

Hosted/device acceptance still required:

- Connected project `rbvcnvqpdqrhywcgxkne` (`broker-wallet`) is healthy, but
  the available project tools do not expose the hosted Secure Email Change
  toggle. Local `supabase/config.toml` has `double_confirm_changes = true`,
  which does not prove the hosted value.
- In Supabase Dashboard, confirm Secure Email Change and the redirect allowlist
  for `brokerwallet://auth/callback` without changing them during this check.
- On a real device, request a change between two controlled inboxes, approve
  the exact mailbox sequence required by the hosted toggle, verify callback
  routing and same-session uid, then verify Profile/Edit Profile and a cold
  restart show the new confirmed email.
- Also exercise resend/cooldown, duplicate submit, invalid/same/used email,
  logout while pending, and account-switch isolation.

PROJECT ORDER

1. EMAIL CHANGE — VERIFIED_RUNTIME (complete).
2. PASSWORD — next.
3. DELETE ACCOUNT
4. GOOGLE / APPLE — deferred until later.

Phone auth for sign-in/sign-up is not in this order: it is legacy-Firebase only
and its UI presence is a product-owner decision, not an open checkpoint.

Facebook authentication remains removed.

ACCOUNT / PROFILE CHECKPOINT — REAL-DEVICE ACCEPTANCE (2026-09-12)

The product owner completed real-device acceptance. Statuses below are their
observations, not inferences from tests.

EMAIL CHANGE — VERIFIED_RUNTIME

Verified by the product owner on a real device:

- Email Change works end to end.
- The Secure Email Change two-mailbox flow works.
- The confirmed email updates correctly.
- Email Change remains reachable from Edit Profile.

Secure Email Change remains ENABLED in hosted Supabase. The deep-link
predicate, the callback classification and the resend address correction are
therefore runtime verified, not just code proven.

EDIT PROFILE UI POLISH — VERIFIED_RUNTIME / ACCEPTED

Accepted by the product owner on a real device:

- The polished Edit Profile layout is accepted.
- English layout accepted.
- Arabic / RTL layout accepted.
- Name save still works.
- Profile image save still works.
- Email Change entry still works.
- Add Phone entry still works.
- No UI regression reported.

The change was presentation only: no business logic, repository boundary, save
behavior, image-upload path, phone flow or email-change state was modified.

- Compact identity header: 84px avatar with its camera affordance plus a
  "Change photo" action, name, and the confirmed email as secondary LTR text
  that ellipsizes instead of wrapping. The separate hint chip was removed.
- Quiet uppercase section labels group the form: Personal information, Email,
  Phone.
- Email and phone rows share one card treatment, padding and radius, so neither
  reads as more important than the other. The confirmed email stays primary and
  ellipsizes to one line; the change action is a compact secondary text button.
- A pending email change shows only the compact one-line indicator that opens
  the pending sheet. The old large status card was not reintroduced.
- Page padding is a consistent 20px; the 80px gap above Save is gone; the Save
  button radius matches the cards, and a one-line note states that Save covers
  name and photo while email and phone are confirmed separately.

PHONE LOGIN / SIGNUP UI RESTORATION — VERIFIED_UI

Verified by the product owner on a real device:

- The Login Phone tab is visible and selectable.
- The Sign-up Phone tab is visible and selectable.

This status covers the UI restoration only. It is explicitly NOT a statement
about phone authentication working.

The Phone tab had been hidden in commit `0148dbd` behind `phoneSignInAvailable`
/ `phoneSignUpAvailable` without product-owner authorization. The gates were
removed, the tabs render unconditionally again, and the Phone method is
selectable on both screens. No UI was redesigned.

PHONE LOGIN / SIGNUP AUTH FUNCTIONALITY —
NOT IMPLEMENTED / NOT RUNTIME PASS IN SUPABASE MODE

- Phone sign-in and phone registration are implemented on the legacy Firebase
  backend only. With Supabase as the auth authority — the default — neither can
  complete, and neither has been runtime verified.
- Attempting either shows a localized EN/AR message saying the method is not
  available yet and to use email. That message was previously a hard-coded
  English string and is now a localization key.
- Email is the initially selected method wherever phone auth cannot complete,
  so neither screen opens on a method that cannot finish. The Phone tab is
  still present and selectable. Flip `SignInViewModel.initialLoginMethod` /
  `SignUpViewModel.initialSignupMethod` to restore the historical Phone-first
  default.
- No phone authentication architecture was built, no second identity was
  created, and phone login is not wired to the signed-in phone-change flow.
- Restoring this UI does not re-open the phone auth checkpoint.

PHONE ADD / VERIFY IMPLEMENTATION — PRESERVED

The signed-in account Add Phone / phone-verification flow and its hosted
database hardening are unchanged and remain as recorded in the phone checkpoint
above: implementation CODE_PROVEN, hosted DB security PASS, and final real UAE
SMS acceptance still externally deferred pending a business/trade licence, a
production SMS provider and UAE sender registration.

Local verification at acceptance time: full suite 241/241 PASS;
`flutter analyze lib test` zero errors, zero warnings, 112 pre-existing
informational findings in unrelated files.

Open backlog, reported and deliberately not implemented:

- A confirmed phone number has no "change" entry point in Edit Profile.
- The restored phone login form keeps a pre-existing hard-coded 280px spacer.
- `tapToChangePhoto` is now an unused localization key.
- Both `.arb` files contain roughly 450 pre-existing duplicate keys; a
  JSON-based tool will silently drop the earlier copies.

NOW — nothing is pending on this checkpoint. Review the staged working tree and
commit the Account/Profile work when you are ready; the generated plugin
registrant files under `linux/flutter/`, `macos/Flutter/` and `windows/flutter/`
carry no content change and must stay out of that commit.

NEXT — start the PASSWORD checkpoint.
